Zerodha Kite,Play,"From last 2/3 months it's hell of a experience to use kite application. Charts never loads. Just never. Pathetic. I waited a lot that, in your updates problem will resolve but it never happened. Also option chain opening takes lot of time.! Even in search it gets hanged.! Give stability or will have to close the account. Edit : I have 100 Mbps internet speed from two different service providers and using it with load balancing router. So issue is DEFINITELY from your side.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Prices are not real time. There's always a lag of few seconds. Whenever order gets exicuted notification comes first, price updates after a few seconds. Charts don't load instantly. Some times they don't load at all. The circle keeps rotating. Overall experience is slackish . Don't blame it on my internet connection. I have 5g on mobile, and 100mbps at home. Everything else is superfast, Kite is slow.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Everytime I close the app, the app is logout and I have login and initialize every time. - I have no power saving options enabled. - It's a issue always when I close the app with back gesture. It really is annoying. My friends also find it annoying. - Why does the battery needs to be unoptimized? I am a developer myself and I know that it is a bug and not related to any battery settings.
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"The latest version is very slow. The charts never load for some stocks. The 3 dots keep on going as per the animation but chart never loads for some. There is no issue in the internet speed as other apps and all are working fine. Please fix this. If we can't see the charts what the point of having them then in the app if we can't see them in real-time.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Very good app but I have always had a trouble loading the graphs and from the past 2 weeks I am noticing that the graphs are not loading at all even on a very good internet connection. Due to which I have to switch to other application and it is not a good experience. Overall if I'm willing to place an order. Edit - Graphs are working fine, but it still lacks some important features such as - Specifying whether the equity is long term or short term - brief history against an equity
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"Very bad experience with the performance of the app, It takes great amount of time while opening or flipping charts in different time frames, entries booking also takes a heck of the time. The worst part is the support team does not respond in a proper way accepting the glitches we point out. In turn, they tell lies saying that everytthing works well.
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"The app was great once upon a time. Overtime in the name of upgrades, Kite has just deteriorated my experience. Recently, the Fundamentals section of the stocks has been changed (probably some API to another vendor app named TIJORI). It is completely cluttered and sore to the eyes. Why do you change something that is fine and no one is complaining about? Instead you could work on the chart loading issues, random network issues during market volatility times, etc.
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"Latest updated version is not good. Whenever try to refresh the margin on android, order is place because of order tap button,  it is too close to the margin reftesh button. Some times buy order place  mistakenly. There should be swipe button instead of tap button to buy the order.  I think tap button has been created to increase the brokerage. Thinking to shift to another broker.
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"Many a times trend lines drawn disappear by the next day, very frustrating. The developer claims it's because of cache being cleared, but haven't ever cleared cache. Total 700 stocks can b added to watchlist but alerts still Limited to 200 only which makes it difficult to catch the breakout, it should be 700 as the same as watchlist!
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"New Android Update changed the UI a lot for buying or selling and is confusing, old UI of buying or selling with clear buttons showing CNC and MIS order to select was much easy to understand and simple, now having a intraday toggle is confusing and most of the times ignored .. Better consider the old UI for Buying or selling which has buttons to choose Updated Response: Only the Intraday Toggle is not as simple as having two options of MIS(Intraday) and CNC (Delivery) You can take a poll

Zerodha Kite,Play,"I finally open Zerodha account after 5 years of constant fight in my mind yes no yes....I am using Angle one since 2019 and I want to say after using Zerodha, app design, look, and specially fonts size and type need to be improved it is very simple and sophisticated. Them option also not so good it is either White or Black....No. of watchlist are also just 7 in compare toAngle one where the are giving options of Max 10 watchlists. One tab switch between equity and option market is also missing.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"The new text font is looking ugly. Previous font was much better and more readable. Edit: I don't like the Trading View 2.0 chart. There are lot of issues. On clicking a candle it doesnot put cursor on it. Trading View 1.0 chart is much better. Right now I can use TV 1.0 chart. If you force me to use TV 2.0 chart I have to switch to other broker. Edit: I don't like long press. It should be on click to save time during ongoing trades. Edit: I am unable to use TV 1.0 chart. It is better than TV2.0
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"The app is becoming worst day by day the charts are taking lots of time to load. Also while trading in FnO there should be quick interface of exiting the potion in just one click. In night the does not work. The use of drawing pattern is also not easy on chart it takes a bit effort. Try solving this problems or else I think we should shift to some other broker.
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"User interface is too bad and complicated, make UI as Groww simple and easy to understand. 1.When we search we don't get proper results ( mapping is not good) 2. Nifty, banktnifty should be on top. 3. If we open banktnifty or anything then there should be button for option trading down with drop-down. 4. Stop loss thing is quite complicated to implement/ takes too much time to learn.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"after completion of sign-up process and paying 200 bucks, I didn't receive my userid and password. it's been more than a week. the most pathetic customer support. don't go with zerodha. I have sent 20 emails almost. but no solution. every time they say that your esign process hasn't completed but I have completed it so many times and sent you the attachment of the last screen. I have done everything I could. I will never recommend such an app which can't find the problem in account opening.
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"Easy to use and track, support is also good and timely without fail. Edit: new downgrade which kite calls upgrade is not helping anyone most customers are extremely dissatisfied I'm in the process of moving platforms there are much better options available T.T. was much better than tijori and I have no choice it's been enforced. It's like I have to not only go through my garbage but others garbage too to find basic info I used to previously gather easily without going to 3rd party page.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"*Note-taking Feature:* - The notes I add to a stock should be visible in my portfolio. - The notes should sync uniformly across all watchlists and portfolios. *Portfolio Management:* - Provide more sorting and filtering features in the portfolio, such as: - Ability to mark investments as ""long-term"" or ""short-term"". Segregate bonds against stocks and other groupings by different colors. These implementations are not that difficult and it won't have performance impact to the app

Zerodha Kite,Play,"The app and website is giving a hard time in launching. Even if it launches after a big hurdle, opening the charts are another level challenge. It never opens and always says ""Error fetching chart. Please try again later"" in both app and website. I have to use another app to view charts and buy/sell here. Just pathetic and time wasting.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Can't save chart in updated version then how to save study,can't put cursor on it to see low and high of the candle previous t1 version was much better but can't use it, also can't watch multiple charts at a time very bad experience today facing issue from morning and will face a loss...Please improve your app otherwise have to switch to other platform. Today I have placed some orders money get deducted but cant see in my position also it shows in pending order neither cancelling nor modifying.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"it was good before. Recent updates made it difficult to use. Before 1) in 2022 it was simple so faster loading and less glitches. 2) charts take too much time to load.charts starts blinking randomly. 3) randomly logging out and need to sign in again. 4)No need to have a big watchlist. Current one can hold all of nifty 500. Pros 1)the new fundamental viewing part and sensibul integration.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Since update, they are showing corporate action like split, bonus and divident on chart, its highly irritating and there is no way to hide it in Kite App. I need a clean chart so that I can see my own choosen indicators. Its so stupid to show something which is not even a deciding factor to take a trade. its always like that, management just decide something stupid and impose on users. since update I am using angel one's chart. thanks kite management for running kite charts.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"The team is lethargic and non responsive. Other brokers like dhan have much better offerings than 0dha. Basic features like bar change and percentage change takes months to implement in application. It started well but now they are so lost that they are finding it difficult to implement small changes to their system, acting like PSUs

Zerodha Kite,Play,"The new order window update is suck. I'm using this application over three year because of its easy interface but in this recent update it's not so easy to use. We have to first switch on the SL button that we can put the SL which is taking little long time. If you can then please fixed this otherwise I have leave this platform.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Need improvement in charts. Overall app is number one. Web browsing editing charts are not sync to mobile kite app. That make some frustrated. Because whenever i am out from my setup, my levels not be sync in kite other hand that make trading difficulties. So improve in chart synchronisation web to app.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Nice app until last month Because am facing to many technical issues regarding charts etc and i informed team zerodha but they didn't respond. I do mails to them but theh are unable to solve my issue. That is main cause of loss booking. I wait approximately 1 hour of loading but no chart has open!!
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"I would give zero to the app. Service charges are very very very very high. In Alice blue if we withdraw amount 5000. Even if there is no sufficient balance the app tried to send what is remaining with exact decimals. This zerodha is such a useless one. In case of deposit very immediate. But when we keep withdraw for 5k and even if there is 4999 the withdraw gets rejected. Useless useless useless app. Everyone go for alice blue. You will find a bigggggggggggg difference in charges.
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"Using Zerodha and two other broker apps for above one year and as per my experience, Zerodha is the worst app, even some basic features (GTT Market order) are missing. It's interface is very poor and not users friendly, so would never recommend it to the beginners, better to choose any other broker app, I am quite sure that would be better than Zerodha, because their platform is very basic, as they are not upgrading it as per the user requirements. I realised this, when I used other apps.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Worst application.It does not support most of the time.tbey should know in share market seconds also matter.but in open itself it takes half an hour.and customer support.Its lol It feels like they don't know who to resolve and the big thing they don't even try to understand issue .

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Over the years this app is becoming worse. The app is slow, takes a lot to time to open and also the interfaces are back dated. I don't quite know why such a big company cannot launch a good aap. It feels way backward compared to its competitor groww.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"App does not have simple user interface to log ticket booking. Even resultant page is not straight forward.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"There is one issue with this app. Whenever we press back button on fingerprint authentication screen, it logs the user out and then the user has to fill all login details and also to enable 2 factor authentication. Rather, when we press the back button it should just bring user out of the app instead of logging him/her out.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Zerodha is good platform but lacking many features. Like scalper mode in DHAN . We need scalper mode so that we can enter and exit from the chart itself like DHAN.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"It seems too much horrible and disappointing when you charge 200rs for demate account opening charge before whole sign up process. I lost my money but didn't get completed my sign up on kite app Document verification with digilocker showing completed but then it automatically closes that's interface also most pathetic customer support from the team regarding issues.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"I am using kite app since last 6 to 7 years. In recent app update, difference in price is very confusing. E.g. consider nifty index closed previously at any level and today its trading above previous close. Still it calculates from day high and show as negative. So if anyone had not checked the previous close price would get confuse whether index or stock is positive or not. Update: Dev team responded and guided the settings which worked. Thanks team.
",neutral
Zerodha Kite,Play,"Very shameless app. Deduct charges whether account opening process is completed or not. Account opening process is too much complicated, again and again asking to verify same thing. If due to any reason process completed then again has to start from beginning. And for all process, it will direct on google. It should be given negative marking and Google should scrap this app from play store. This app is just to grab money.
",negative
Zerodha Kite,Play,"Thanks for your quick response and appreciaiting my feedback. Still needs lots of improvements. Many time charts opens up with previous scripts and chart screen again ask for login verification. Also eveytime showing disclaimer is worst thing. You can implement it in non intrusive manner.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Hello team zerodha. I think you should provide the quick buy and quick sell button in trading view 2.0. for trailing stoploss it's very time consuming process via modified stoploss genarate order again modified it . So with reference of plus button you should provide that quick buy with set lot size and quick exit of preferred lot size so we can go with high speed trade like scalping

Zerodha Kite,Play,"This chart on Zerodha got different from today. Previously, we could set and customize the chart as per our preference, but now, nothing at all is getting set.

Zerodha Kite,Play,"Been using this app for more than two years now, and I find this app pretty reliable. But I rated it one star down because, it recently made selling stocks a bit inconvenient in an irritating way. Previously we could authorize selling operatiom once a day and could sell any stock throughout the day, but now each stock with particular quantity needs to be authorised for selling individually before I can sell it. It's basically irritating and wastage of time. Previous system was way better.

They don't respond to your tickets for more than a day even though they say they'll update in 24 hours. Arranged a call twice, didn't get a call the 1st time, and got a recording the 2nd time that played for 10 seconds. After trying multiple times, finally talked to a person, who just repeated the same stuff, instead of understanding or trying to resolve it. Faced lots of technical glitches too.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Worst one. Don't go through it. It's just like a trap. You will lose your money. I ordered 2 same items (only print different) at a time. But they created it 2 different order with different IDs. When I received the item it was a single package but the amount paid for both items and I was surprised to see that there was only one item. I returned the item and only got 50% . Again and again I applied for balance amount and every time I was asked to return the 2nd package, which I never received.
",negative
Groww,Play,"This app goes down at crucial times, sometimes you can't add money, or sometimes it won't open at all. Sometimes you buy options, and when you want to sell it, the app crashes, and I've lost my funds because of this issue. Moving away from this to Zerodha or Angle One, they are better in interfaces and backend.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Impressive App. Simple and quick. Mobile Phone device sometimes feel to be bottleneck. Lot of friends prompted other apps but I feel my decision to go with Groww is right and Groww makes it even better. I follow their YouTube channel too which gives a good idea. Getting onboard was the best experience. Technical section just below the stock graph gives you many possibilities to check various parameters. You can choose the indicators from top right corner for same. You don't need other apps.

Groww,Play,"I recently started my investing journey with the Groww app, and it has been an incredibly smooth and user-friendly experience. The app makes it so easy to invest, keep track of all my holdings, and compare different funds. The interface is intuitive and well-designed, allowing even beginners to navigate and understand their investments effortlessly. I highly recommend Groww to anyone looking to start investing or manage their existing portfolio with ease.
",positive
Groww,Play,"Absolutely pathetic app, you can't exit your order at market price if you have placed a target and SL. If we exit at chart screen with and B and S option orders doesn't get executed, we need to exit twice. Absolutely horrible app, zerodha is better for order modification. Absolutely nightmare. If you want to connect to support for urgent matters, call gets connected only after 10 mins. lots of losses may happen due to technical glitches with app and they don't take any accountability for it.
",negative
Groww,Play,"kindly add a function regarding adding notes to stocks as it will avoid the need to keep notes in another app. for reference, similar feature has been receently added by zerodha. Further it would be really helpful if the holdings can be bifurcated in two or more sections... like one may have some holdings with long term view and some for very short term, so it would be more efficient and easy to keep track if holdings could be divided into two or more sections at the end of the user.

Groww,Play,"I recently started using the Groww app and have been thoroughly impressed. It's incredibly easy to use and very user-friendly, making it perfect for both beginners and experienced investors. The app is fast, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience when managing my investments. I highly recommend Groww to anyone looking for a reliable and straightforward investment platform.
",positive
Groww,Play,"not that soothing and convenient experience in this app. the customer support doesn't exist. they provide some chatroom and it's damn waste. transferring amount and stock purchase are easy. anyone can understand the process as it's easy and simple but If you encounter with any issue no one will be there to help. there's no point in saying it's free. it's good to charge decent Fee and provide better customer support
",negative
Groww,Play,"One of the best apps for trading, that I have come across. One star less because details of sold stocks and the relevant profit/loss cannot be found in the app. Profit and Loss Report is sent only by email on request. Another feature that can be improved is the market depth. It doesn't show the number of buy and sell orders.
",positive
Groww,Play,"Worst app. When the market is down it freezes the payment options , this happened with many users and also the freezing of payment went on for 2-3 hours. There is no point of this app. Although the issue has been resolved please note that this app is meant for stock market investment which is a time sensistive thing. Simply resolving the issue after the market is closed doesn't work. If your servers cannot handle the user interaction then its high time that you should invest in infrastructure.
",negative
Groww,Play,"From being the best app to not even close to normal or worst trading app now, plenty of bugs, app glitches and lags alot, have been a groww user since 2 years now, and now its the most worst experience with groww. Have complained multiple times regarding charts freezing suddenly during market hours, pressing back button from a chart or company, will take the app directly to the main home screen, apps takes time to load, very slow and disappointing. Groww use to be really good before a few update
",negative
Groww,Play,"It's my first ever platform to invest into stocks and mutual funds and so far I'm pretty comfortable using this application. The timely updates and the reminders are helpful. It seems the interface is also easy to use and understand and execute. As of now I'm still a newbee for stock market but as I'll have more understanding and experience, I'll share more feedback about Groww app. Thank you developers.
",positive
Groww,Play,"Such a horrible experience. When the market crashes this application also crashes, leaving no chance to buy or sell stocks during that time. I tried to contact customer care and they never care about our issues. Not able to make good profits due to application fault. Hope there is any option for minus (-) rating.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Poor interface. Groww should improve portfolio tab. Display Total %returns, %daily return, today's price, avg invested price simultaneously. Need to select from drop-down each time. Other brokers have much better ui. Needs more watchlists and sorting options. These are basic things. Basically this App needs improvements.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Seriously I am getting too many technical glitches in this application..Sometimes order can't be sold properly..It is taking too much time..Sometimes Issue with wallet & Charts.. One more major issue is ""The Filter is not working to sort the stocks & Sorted order is not saved after clicking save button"" Hope the technical team will address these issues..
",negative
Groww,Play,"A recommendation to you guys, being new to this app and stock market i have clicked on ""Sell at market price"" in a few cases mistakenly and the app just sold my stocks. There should be a re-confirmation taken from the user like ""Do you really want to sell it as per market price"" ""Yes or No"" option. Cuz i lost my bidding opportunities due to these errors from my end. This option may prevent a lot of errors of new users. The app works really smooth, and i really love the dark theme.
",positive
Groww,Play,"Session expires so often & then I'm not able to sign in again. Worst is when it expires right when the market opens. App lags alot. Updating the review as on 4th June: Along with market crash the app crashed too. Unable to add funds & customer support screen is also giving a technical error. Really bad app!
",negative
Groww,Play,"I'm using a SAMSUNG Android tablet with a keyboard. In this environment, the app should support fixed landscape screen mode. However, this app doesn't support appropriate landscape mode. All objects on the screen are small, and it's uncomfortable for me. Please update to support landscape screen mode.
",negative
Groww,Play,"The groww app has been crashing most of the time and is incurring huge losses. Even on 7th June it crashed multiple times on nifty and sensex charts. The sensex charts are still unavailable. Such poor app. And Groww app should take responsibility of the losses to its customers if proven so. Also , the servers groww use must be updated. I have been facing this issue for over a month now.
",negative
Groww,Play,"The app is easy to use right from opening your account to placing orders for investment. The UI is clean and intuitive. I wish they add a widget to track your investments and/or indices. Also a 'lights out' dark mode with a black background would be nice.
",positive
Groww,Play,"Great app ! Just a few things I'd like to see in the coming updates.. 1. Ability to create multiple watchlists, at least 10. Watchlist interface more user friendly and smooth. 2. In the about company section, there is very less information. Please add a submenue containing about what the companies history and what the company is doing in the future. A great example would be screener's company details section. Something similar would be great to have here as well.
",positive
Groww,Play,"I have been using this application since 2019 and I feel the user interface has improved greatly. The app is easy to use and great for beginners and veteran investors alike. The interface does not confuse the user and gives clear and simplified access to information that matters the most to users.
",positive
Groww,Play,"I had a really disappointing experience with Grow app. The user interface is clunky and difficult to navigate, making it hard to execute trades efficiently. There were constant technical glitches that led to significant delays and missed trading opportunities. To make matters worse, customer support was unresponsive and unhelpful.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Edit: I mailed the support. Its more than 2 weeks. Didn't receive any proper response. Worst experience. I signed up in groww more than a week ago. I've been getting account creation is in progress due to tech issue. When I tried to reach the so called ""24×7 Support"" the link didn't even work. I gave my very personal data for account creation. Now I don't even know what happend to them. Its really worst experience with Groww.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Great interface but can you please include more options in terms of frequency of investment? Weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly would be great. Also, in case I'm making an external investment in an SIP it's not importing and reflecting on the dashboard even when I'm trying to. Need a bit of help with that.

",negative
Groww,Play,"I am using this. It has lots of errors. Fund transfer errors very frequent. Amount gets deducted from bank but doest show in grow. There is no customer support also. You end up with huge losses due to error in software as stock prices moves. Automated message days resolving issue takes 7 working days. In 7 days stock prices will change or contract will expire.
",negative
Groww,Play,"EDIT: Good for Trading and investment in Mutual Fund. App updates are very frequent and the problems still exist. Pity that the main procedure regarding payment issue and Main Balance glitch still exists. Even you add money to wallet (Successful transfer), you cannot use it to BUY orders;shows ERROR/ Balance cannot be fetched. This happens much often.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Today my delivery option got automatically executed without placing the order. I would have made 10000 profit. but due to this my trade got early exit. Also chart closes automatically and live data gets stuck and auto refresh is not happening. paying brokerage is waste to this people. worst app ever seen in my life. don't install this app.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Worst app. Lost lots of money. I have stocks available for sale but it showing no shares available. Sometimes it's showing available shares but if I want to sale it is showing ""something went wrong"". If can't sale the shares in right time then what's the purpose of using this? I had faced such issues multiple times before. Even login issue. Moreover when one step is okay somehow then next step is not working. But this time it is a huge lose.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Simple UI with some bugs. For example, in the holdings under stocks section, bonds also get added as stock holdings which is wrong. Also raising a ticket is very difficult in the app, as one needs to search the button to do so which shows up after 3 or 4 levels of help.
",negative
Groww,Play,"App is full of glitches of various kinds. Stock prices, buy amounts, available balance, etc. are often shown wrong. Purchase type automatically shifts from delivery to intraday, which costs you a freaking 10% commission which is not properly mentioned in documentations on the web. Commissions charged by the app are not displayed transparently and the docs they send over email are absolutely not user-friendly.
",negative
Groww,Play,"Most of the time i cant open the app because it is Always showing ooops something went wrong. I called the customer care several times but no one is answering my phone calls. I received a mail stating that update your app. I updated it but still same problem (Oops something went wrong) persists.
",negative
Groww,Play,"I've had a terrible experience with customer care. For the past 20 days, I've been trying to completely close my Groww account. However, each time I contact them, they only confirm that my stock account is closed and then close my ticket. Other apps provide a direct option to delete accounts, but this app doesn't even process the request. I know they'll respond to this review by asking me to email or call, which I've already done multiple times
",negative
Groww,Play,"The app is user-friendly and stable. Just a suggestion: it would be great if all investments could be viewed on one page with a pie chart showing the breakdown, like 60% Mutual Funds and 40% Equity. This feature would enhance the overall experience. Keep up the good work!

Groww,Play,"Since the recent update, the fingerprint scanner no longer works to open the app, though it works fine on other apps. Entering my password each time is inconvenient. Additionally, the brokerage fees are quite high, and it feels like I give more to brokerage than I earn. I hope these issues get fixed soon.
",negative
Groww,Play,"I have been using this app for more than a year now, and my review is genuine. No doubt this app is user friendly to invest. Gives you a lot of insights and helps to invest in stocks and mutual funds quickly. Off late, there has been issues with the dashboard not getting updated, showing wrong values etc. Customer support won't understand the issue unless you escalate, and the issue re-occurs. App is slightly skewed towards some stocks I felt, when compared to others.

Groww,Play,"Seriously this app is such a scam I am going to mark a complaint against the same as I had invested in a stock and after redeeming the amount I am still seeing it as invested there only and after making new investment it all get stuck and unable to redeem the new one also trying contacting grow multiple time but no one helps me and unable to contact them as well.

Groww,Play,"My account is still not activated after more than one month since I signed up. The customer support said everything is OK from my end...I don't know what's wrong at Groww's end... but something is terribly wrong I can say!! A quick service and timely feedback would be appreciated.

Groww,Play,"This app deserves no stars at all. It’s utterly disappointing and unacceptable. On every crucial day, there are persistent deposit issues, withdrawal issues, and TPIN issues. How can an investor possibly trust this platform under these circumstances? Today’s trading session was the final nail in the coffin for me. The constant technical glitches and lack of reliable service have eroded my trust and patience. I strongly advise potential users to consider other options.

Groww,Play,"I hate it when apps force me to update with their update description not being properly detailed Edit: I received a call from them later for feedback and hopefully they work on it later and fox this issue along with 1 more suggestion I adviced to them Edit 2: Fix your account statements export. Instead of an incompatible Excel sheet format use pdf which includes all our past transactions and shares holdings with custom date range. It is not properly formatted and available in a single statement.

Sometimes the graph doesn't even visible and sometimes it's a different graph of different stock.

Groww,Play,"Worst of the worst app one could use to trade in stocks . Here are some reasons why : 1) It will lag during the time of important events like market crash and you won't be able to exit your trade. 2) it will deduct the unusual amount from your balance without giving any proper reason. 3) There customer support service is so poor that you can give negative stars for there customer support. 4) They will make you wait for indefinite period of time. 5) They'll put your call on hold and won't ans.

Groww,Play,"The worst app for trading, it is so bad, it is a very bad experience, I would suggest you not to use this app, use any other app without it, your money will also be safe for trading. I would transfer all my money and delete the account, I don't want such a useless app which leads to loss after loss. The reason being, I placed the order at the market price and the order got executed at the current rate after half an hour. Because of this, I suffered a loss of Rs 10,000.

Groww,Play,"Not recommended at all, I don't know how this became India's no 1 with no customer support and I am finally qiuiting due not able to open account trying for 1 month. This is as hard as govt application. Even if anyone wants to try, all the best.

Groww,Play,"There are many reputable apps out there that provide a good and reliable platform along with proper support--which is an absolute when your money is involved. Don't expect any assistance from Groww. My money is stuck since last month and no one has bothered to get back to me, despite repeated reminders. It's risky to download this app. Read the reviews about support before you download.
",negative
Groww,Play,"This app is worst for Futures and options. Only use this to loose money. Horrible app with no support and explanation. They have system generated square offs, but doesn't know to write a simple code to call customers before square offs. I tried reaching out to their customer care and it was useless. Now I'm seeing videos saying their mutual fund investment is not safe and it doesn't let you withdraw money. It is very alarming as I have done major investments from groww.

Groww,Play,"There is a recent bug in groww app which i am facing. At the day end groww send a notification for congratualations with wrong profit/loss figure. I've earned higher amount and congratulations messages just picks up few trades profit/loss and not the total returns and displays it. Please fix this bug urgently to avoid spreading misinformation about returns to many people.

Groww,Play,"Worst app in terms of depositing and refunding money. I missed a huge trade because my deposit of 1,000 through UPI is not reflecting in my Groww deposit balance although it's been debited from my bank 1hr ago. Customer support does not respond yet. Who will compensate for my opportunity loss? Better leave such apps. As per the help support amount should reflect instantly through UPI deposit. Complete failure of an app. Such a bad experience.
",negative
Groww,Play,"This app is a very good app indeed, but need to add few more advanced features like other leading apps. There should be the entry and exit price in the closed position, Greeks, PCR, OI change etc required to shown in a single screen for quick decision. And many more advanced features required to be included in the app.

You won't be able access your money or you won't be able to sell or you won't be able to buy at the most critical moments. Absolutely rubbish. Not going to use this app for investing in stocks anymore. Edit : Updating my rating from 1 star to 3 stars for ease of use. Ease of use gets 6 stars out of 5.

Groww,Play,"The app's interface is incredibly user-friendly and a pleasure to use compared to other brokerage platforms I've tried.

Groww,Play,"Not worth even a star. This application isn't capable of executing orders in trending market. This has happened to me a couple of times however today it showcased their incompetency. It incurred a heavy loss due to their application issue in executing orders. The app wasn't able to trigger any SL, Exit all or Safe Exit features. Do avoid this app and prefer Zerodha, Dhani or any other reliable broker.

Groww,Play,"They're the one who manipulates their users and don't let them to skip their SIPs and forcing them to cancel it.

Groww,Play,"I'm missing my SIPs. My SIP date is 2 of every month and if it falls on a weekend or holiday I'm unable to pay for that month. Your app doesn't allow to pay on same day deu to off(understandable) but doesn't allow to pay even the next working day and marks my SIP not paid. I'm missing my SIPs due to you guys. I don't want to set auto-pay, I remember my payments. Let me do my payments. And shoving auto-pay down my throat after every transaction is very annoying.

Groww,Play,"Very poor customer service. Only mode of contacting for help is through mail or chat, which takes a lot of time. The mailing response comes after 20-24 hours. No direct helpline available. They have a contact number on public portals, but they never respond. All you go through is the IVR tone and a very very long wait time. No query addressal system. Whenever a discrepancy happens, all they have to say is ""sorry,"" and no further action is taken. The platform is good, but not the customer service

Groww,Play,"Keep up frequent updates. S.I.P calculators does not consider tax, inflation, charges deducted, expense ratio, so final amount is not real and is inflated to attract armature investors.

Groww,Play,"This is a very basic app. The holdings view is very poor. Worst part is Holdings is kind of a watchlist put besides other watchlist. Holdings should have all possible critical parameter in one view - for example LTP, current price, avg buy price, etc etc and should not ask to click again and again. Orders of the day view is also poor. I never found it user friendly. I mostly get lost finding today's orders. Way to go for Groww app. There is no shame to follow other well placed app in this area

So cheap tricks are applied in this app.

Groww,Play,"Quite good one but need somewhere improvement. There must be a feature of search inside the watchlist.

Every time when I use a Stoploss, the app automatically sold all my active transactions, that too at a much lower price than the stoploss.

Groww,Play,"Good app for investing and tracking portfolios. Perhaps the only thing it lacks is the non-existence of daily trend on stock holdings. The same is present for mutual funds, where one can see the trends under ""portfolio analysis"". Something similar for stocks would be a good feature to have.

I saw the market was down by close to 8% on 04th June and thought there is an opportunity to invest and invested 10k (lumpsum) on a mutual fund. It was during the market hours. It showed the NAV date as 4th June and now all of a sudden it has changed to NAV of 5th June!? when market is 4% up. I can feel that it's a SCAM by these brokers playing with customers money!

After this period passed without resolution, I contacted customer support and was instructed to raise a ticket, which also promised a 24-48 hour resolution.This continued delay has caused me to miss out on purchasing stocks.

Groww,Play,"Notifications for stock movements in the watchlist; Earlier they used to clearly notify whether a stock was moving up or down while crossing the notification benchmark. Now they just notify that the stock has crossed the benchmark. The app designers think that it will create more engagement as users will log into the app to check the movement of their stock in watchlist. On the contrary it creates resentment in the users, as a privilege to stock accurately has been taken away. So bye bye.

Upstox,Play,"I am user of UPSTOX it is incredible in using and showing you real time data Upstox is a budget-friendly trading app with a user-friendly interface, advanced charting tools, and ok - ok brokerage fees. It offers seamless account opening and multiple asset classes but can experience server downtimes and has average customer support. Ideal for cost-conscious traders, though beginners might face a learning curve.

Upstox,Play,"I've been using Upstox for a while and it's one of the fastest brokers out there. However, the PCR (Put-Call Ratio) data isn't updated automatically and manual refreshes often show data that's 5-8 minutes old. Sensibull has only a 3-minute delay, which is more efficient. Additionally, The PCR chart works well on the mobile app but lacks functionality on the web application. Everything else is great, but Sensibull would be more useful if it were fully free.

Upstox,Play,"Indicators not working properly. If we move a candlestick chart, indicators are supposed to move.

Same happened with moving averages also Need to fix the bug immediately

Upstox,Play,"(1) You don't deliver news quickly in wishlist. Also, in stock news section, news is delivered very late. Make the app's news section, and wishlist news section reliable. For example: Q1 2025 result of KRBL was published on 31st July 2024 but as of now it is 1st August 11:10am and that news is still not available in Upstox, neither in wishlisted news section. (2) Also, many news are omitted withing a few days. But, many other news remain for as long as few months. You have 2 things to upgrade.

Upstox,Play,"Too many unnecessary notifications. Even after turning off all notifications except order updates the app settings, it keeps popping spam notifications. As a result I had to completely disable all notifications which makes the app less useful.

Few days back I was not able to find the NFO option for new mutual funds, and I eventually have up trying after 10 minutes of clicking all options available, I'm not even sure now that you even have that option or not. My suggestion - Build something like Groww or INDMoney if you want to retain customers.

Upstox,Play,"It is amazing. But there is one suggestion. Since I like to trade intraday i need to be able to look at multiple indices chart one after the other. It is hard to select them in the drpp down menu over and over again.

Upstox,Play,"App was best before the update(Deserved 5 Star). Since the latest update the chart is lagging and some changes done in candlestick or chart made new problems. For Example :- Before the update on 1D(1 Day)default view I was able to see the candlestick body and wicks clearly without any zooming but now it just looks straight lines. Also if any indicator is applied to chart everytime I reopen or reload the chart the indicator is not visible untill I slide chart. Solve the problem soon.

Long press on list should show the switch to list menu or just switch to next list.

Upstox,Reddit,"There should be an option by which we can see chart continiously with out pressing the back button , just like trading view mobile app. Once we enter in a chart then we can see all charts one after another. But now in new Upstox app we have to press back button after every single chart to get back to watchlist again and then press another stock to watch another chart. This feature of tradingview should be added as sson as possible.

I ended up paying twice the amount and neither of the transaction is confirmed even though the amount has been deducted twice from my bank account.

Paytm Money,Play,"I have forgotten the login password while using the app. Now in order to reset the password they have given a number from which I should call. It's a very bad option, other trading platforms are giving so many easy options to reset the password, why it is not there. Kindly guide me to reset the login password.

Paytm Money,Play,"Overall the app is very good, responsive, and executes orders quite fast. Fonts and clarity of content is there. However, it wastes space at many places, doesn't allow customization, requires multiple click and drill down to see more details about stock, holdings, orders etc. After adding money, goes to watchlist and not dashboard or where it was earlier.
",positive
Paytm Money,Play,"App is good but the support is really poor, almost non existent. Only chat available and they take days and sometimes weeks to reply to issues. There is no call center. So it gets very stressful when there is an issue with your investment or redemption. Not sure how can they make a financial application live without having a reliable support structure in place.

Paytm Money,Play,"Positives: 1. Nice and clean UI. 2. All funds of the partnered AMCs available. Negatives: 1. Old portfolio import unavailable. Any existing investor will expect old portfolio to come automatically. 2. Franklin funds not present. Conclusion: Old investors won't use the application, if the mentioned issues are not addressed. But the application is intuitive and provides good UX. Problems mentioned easy to solve and expect them to be solved soon. I will update the review after using it for another month. I hope a lot of changes shall happen over the next 1-2 months. Hope to use this application in future.

Paytm Money,Play,"Great UI and my experience with it has been great, but their customer support is very bad. Their customer support chatbot is configured to handle only specific issues, if your issue is not one of them, you are basically screwed.

I had to find their support email online to raise the issue, but I haven't received any support after their acknowledgement email. Please improve your customer support

Paytm Money,Play,"You're doing awesome, but recently after April update, the app gets stuck for longer time on the startup page and after some time it gets crashed throwing an error. 1 in 5 trials I'm able to launch the app. Please look into it, otherwise, the app is awesome. Edit 1: The issue of app crashing isn't resolved yet. Got another issue, the text is overlapping in the Goals section where the value of goal is mentioned. Tried uninstalling & reinstalling app. Decreasing 1 star just to get noticed.

Paytm Money,Play,"I liked the simplicity to use the app. But I just lost money due to their technical glitch. App & desktop site didn't reflect the order for a longer time and I repeated the stock order. This lead to short sell of uprising stock and I lost money which I should have earned. Even the app kept on showing me in profit for a long time and suddenly it refreshed to show me in loss. This was just ridiculous experience. Simplicity doesn't cover my money loss. I don't suggest new users to join this app.

Paytm Money,Play,"This is worst app, Their person called me and said there will be no brokerage charge for one month, I started trading and not only they charged brokerage fees but also they charged AMC of 350+ rs.

Paytm Money,Play,"The app is OK. Mostly similar features like other mf apps. Looks a bit cluttered sometimes due to the high amount of information present - however it depends on users how they take it. For me the best part is the consolidated ratings and other fund details available. Fund manager performance also is a good add. It helps me in my research to choose funds. However nothing to push me to use the app for investing. For now will use it for research purposes only. Kuvera app is much more elegant and simple to operate without doing away with essential features.

Paytm Money,Play,"The App seems to have a good interface and it's good to have all investments products under one roof. But the interactions with the staff on text was very poor. The staff and overall the Company does not seem to have any integrity and blatantly lie about facts and figures. While a proper value system seems to be lacking it will be difficult for me to trust them with my life savings.

Paytm Money,Play,"New app UI is good Functionality is good, but it takes forever to withdraw money. They claim I'll be able to withdraw unsettled money within two working days, but you'd be lucky if you get it back in a week. Also, consider making annual transaction history/summary easier to read.

Paytm Money,Play,"Except the design of the app, its really a worst app for trading. Customer service is really pathetic! So I am moving out from this app. Many times, the order has executed only after a few seconds you have initiated the order. By that time the price may have changed a lot. Few other times, when we tried to exit from a trade, it will not executed, so we will try it again. After a few minutes, when we will check the order, there may be multiple orders have placed which we may not initiated!

Paytm Money,Play,"No customer care contact number. Thus no help from customer care except a small message system in the app which is or not much use. App looks good, but everything needs to be self learned and your mistakes cost a lot, also no customer care to call and ask for any help. I lost of lots of time in trying to learn how to use this app before investing. Everything in facing new problems but not knowing how to solve. Bottom line: This app doesn't make investing easy. It only complicates things.

Some funds are exited but they are still there. They ask to unload latest report but don't update the funds from it. It's overall a mess. It's better to go with a better app or just wait for these apps to stabilize. Customer service is pretty bad where they pretend to not understand all the issues with the system.

This is how it is making money instead of any extra cost. So better don't trust this app go for better options.

Paytm Money,Play,"Loved this app. Just a couple of suggestion- Please add some more features so that we can easily choose the better fund or share for e.g. comparison and return after the tax deduction etc. It will give more clear picture of the fund.

I received the call from their end on 10/05/2022 that you can add money and trade as your documents are verified. And i added money bt still for f&o it is showing the same. And no any communication is done by their end. Really very bad experience they r providing to their customers.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Am yet to get my KYC completed. Logout button works only when pressed twice and pin based security even when enabled in security settings does not work. Update: the security button works. Account opening went smoothly. Made investment using this app. Suggest to add Portfolio import features. Sip transactions created before setting up auto-pay mandate failed. Amount got credited back after 5 days. Needs UI decluttering. Or options to customize it. Am still undecided if I will stick with this app. ICICI DIRECT is way superior in terms of features. Also it is taking more time between amount getting deducted from bank and allocation of units .....3 days is definitely long. Orders placed should be processed on same day and units should reflect in account within 3 days. NAV should be the NAV of the date in which order is placed.

While reviewing my transaction statement for last FY, I noticed that few SIPs I paid last year got returned back in my account qnd si don't know the reason. Such experience is scary as we diligently pay our SIPs but if those are not forwarded to AMC, it can be a trust issue.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"DO NOT INVEST ON THIS APP. I am using this app for last 3 years. It's better if you use grow specially after my money got stuck last month and they are still not showing any response to it. It's been more then 20 days but they are still asking me to wait with any expected resolution time and date or any update regarding it. And they do not have any helpline as well to communicate properly.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Investing experience is really bad. Only good looking UI. After payment SIP doesn't get updated with AMC till 3-4 days. And is a problem and loss-making for planned investors, as they don't get the expected NAV. Customer support don't respond for several hours or days even asking about it. The app is full of suggestions on other investment options, instead of making the investment faster. This app is not for serious investors.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"This app is continuously degrading itself... Maybe they are becoming just an advertisement platform where user can login and see some ads and then log off... They have no answer for why there is a mismatch in portfolio when it is directly compared from funds details. It has been more than 2 months following up with them and still they haven't even tried to correct it. It's better to use some other platform than using a app with such poor support.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Useful app because of the simplified interface. i started investing in MF for the first time in my life and this app gives me simple access to understand and choose wisely. Yes, i am a CA aspirant so i have some basic ideas about investing but it's a useful app for all. KYC is done quickly and this app helped me to start investing at an early age and helped me in developing a habit of smart savings and minimizing expenditure. Great app overall !

Paytm Money,Reddit,"I have been facing refund issues multiple times. First the transaction fails and then the app refuses to refund my money unless I do continuous follow up. It generally takes them more than 15 days to refund money after failed transactions. I had to complain to sebi twice to actually get my refund. Latest batch of failed transactions are on 13th January. No refund has been received but app claims money has been deposited in my account. Once more I am getting ready to run from pillar to post.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"I am using this app since last 3 years, I gave it preference over all other mutual funds and investment apps and suggested to a lot of people only because of one reason which you can amend your SIP amount and date.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Have been using this app for past 2+ months. Eventhough the UI is intuitive and the information provided abt MF are good, very disappointed with the following items: 1. SIP most of the time don't get executed. You end up manually invest as lumpsum amount. Even today they missed 2 of my SIPs. 2. Your queries never get answered. They randomly pick few queries and provide half baked answers after several days. No customer support number at all. Only if you post a bad review it will get their attention. I'm increasingly getting frustrated with these and even seriously thinking of switching app.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Superb app for Investments in Mutual Fund, I have ever seen. Specifically for beginners. It's UI is really good, easy to understand and reliable. I had no knowledge about Mutual Funds but this app made me fully understood about stock market and Mutual Funds. One of the best thing about this app is it is fully paperless and online. New user can register itself within 10 minutes and can invest in most of the all Mutual Funds in India and can track the progress of investments whenever he wants.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"I have raised this issue several times. Why do your system keep asking multilevel password/ OTP for selling anything. For buying it is a fraction of second, for selling your process takes few minutes, due to which the user goes in losses. I understand that it is for security reasons but it is not asked in other applications like HDFC and hence, they are much user friendly. Can you please incorporate a setting which when enabled, does not ask these 2 passwords/OTPs while selling?

Paytm Money,Reddit,"The customer support is worst. To change my auto-pay mandate they are taking more than two week and still going on loops. If one takes so much time to just delete auto-pay,i can only wonder about other issues. There is no phone number as well to call them. Considering the volatile markets one would lose their money easily with the kind of slow and irresponsible support we receive here. I wouldn't recommend this app for investing and am planning to invest directly

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Paytm money has to make huge improvement to the app & web app is very immeture. They have a major flaw while making payments through Autopay option, the mobile app and web app both does not show a success/failure message to user. So user tends to click the button twice and Paytm will submit multiple investment requests to investors bank account. When I raised the question with their customer support they suggested to redeem the unwanted units post allocation (what a solution sir ji). What if I am buying an ELSS, should I wait for 3 years to redeem the unintended investments?? The major issue for me is that there is no option to chat / call customer care, it is only by message or email. This is such an important feature for an investment app to deal with the issues with immediate response. Be careful at each step while using their app.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"It takes very long time to get allotted a mutual fund and sometimes the transaction fails.

Right now all goals are added together over same time scale i.e. goal for buying a car and making retirement fund are on same time scale. Current goal adding feature is simply useless. Just because of this feature NOT present in the app I am NOT investing in mutual funds through Paytm Money app.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Extremely cluttered app. It is impossible to find anything without getting lost. Especially for new users. The stocks dashboard and mutual fund dashboard do not have a breadcrumb, there is no common view-all page. Looks like a collection of disparate apps poorly stitched together. Another problem is fund tracker- even after so many attempts I can't find the option to look at incoming fund transactions from sale of shares.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"It's pity that I don't have an option to rate below 1 star, there is no customer service. So many bugs if you are trying to withdraw insta fund.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Interface is pathetic, whenever you open the app you will see various promotional ads which shouldn't be there, instead of that there should be F&O and other trading index.. move offers and investments to different sections as for trading we have to open multiple navigation keys which is a daily hustle. Secondary I personally don't like the swiping method for trading as it is lagy, it also takes loading time which is delays the deal price, as we all know, while scalping every microsecond matters

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Having trouble signing up while entering OTP sent to Gmail. If we reverse back to gmail to get OTP, paytm app directs the user to start from the beginning and could not enter the OTP. This should be solved as many are having the same issues.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"There is a difference in the NAV values displayed in this app. I don't know why. Also it takes 3-4 days to transfer the purchased units, so a sudden rise and fall can completely change the game. It doesn't feel safe to invest with these kind of discrepancies.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Well, the app is good. But lots of feature yet to be added to get complete experience. Best part is price alert which is best amongst all I experience.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Worst way for saving. As they are not charging any money so is the customer support. They won't reply you for days. There is no contact number listed.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"So far, the experience has been good. The app is good for trading stocks and investing in mutual funds. The support is also good enough, especially on Twitter. One thing that bothers me about the app is that it consumes a lot of data.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"UI looks good. Easy to use. Some improvement are still needed. 1. KYC process takes long time. 2. Fund allocation takes little longer time than other applications. 3. You can't update your e-mail address once you have created your account. Currently this is a huge problem for me, as i want to update my email address but i am not able to. And, all the emails are going to my old email address. 4. One suggestion: Please send hard copy of monthly statement to the home address as well. As its always good to have hard copy in case something happens to you and nobody has access to you emails and all this. So, in that case if you have hard copy, then your family members can get the money showing them as a proof.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Paytm Money has very nice and user friendly interfaces. I liked it very much. I have already switch few old funds to here. One most wanted missing feature was introduced - I can now manage my portfolio in its web interfaces in the Desktop. The reason I didn't give full 5 star rating is because few important features is still missing. Please introduce the option to manage multiple portfolio. We have the option to set multiple goal but it is not enough. Suppose I want to manage two goals. One is for my child's education and another one is for my retirement plan. I want to put few funds to my first goal and another sets of funds to second goal. Many popular investment platform like Funds In**a already has this option.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Paytm money app is made for India. Transparent review and full details of a fund however it is not perfect. If you're a new user it is really good app for you. Please note: It lags some basic points: 1. Changes in bank account, if added a wrong bank account first it will be default for all time. 2. You can't make watchlist, this means if you like a mutual fund you can't save it, if you want to invest in it later. 3. No dedicated customer care for fat response. Overall this a good app for Paytm.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Hey Paytm your onboarding process is very slow. I think you should speed up the KYC process. After all, what's the point of having Fintech service when you can't get your account activated quickly, even after submitting all data correctly. Second thing why do the user has to go through all the hassle of making KYC approved account before browsing the information in the app. This is not a fair practice where you are forcing the customer to upload all the information without even having to see what's inside the app. Maybe I don't want to buy a mutual fund right now but I just want to see the information.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"So many negative reviews? Don't know what more people need. In my honest opinion everything is so smooth simple and great about this app. 1. KYC was flawless for me. 2. Adding Bank did not worked initially. Reported the bug, fixed very soon. Got my bank verified after that. 3. Auto Pay works and enabled paperlessly. All and all everything for free and broke the mutual funds apps industry. Great job Paytm and team. Great work on UI too. Kudo's to developers.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Very poor customer care service. There is no number where we can reach out for our issue. Only option is to ping under help section. I am facing an issue for which I raised concern but no response. On following up no response at all. The issue is still open. Very sad to see this.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Still too many bugs. 1. Changed the proof from Adhar card to Passport but the drop down option is not changing which is causing rejection of KYC. 2. Tried to upload Adhar card and enter Adhar card details but always popping up that failed to update address. 3. No helpline number or chat support available. I am not sure why we need to use this when there is many more such apps available in market. I am already a KYC fulfilled user and investing online in mutual funds still taking so much time on this platform.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Worst broker. Not able to buy/sell any new stock options in last week of monthly expiry.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"Hi, Have Been using this app for more than 2 years. Ui/ux is great and pretty easy to use also . Once raised a complaint regarding fund transfer from Paytm Payments Bank to Paytm Money which was resolved (although it took a week).To be able connect to over call would surely add to customer experience.The in-app customer care bot also needs little improvement. Overall, it's been pretty comfortable and nice experience. Highly recommend it for all equity trading and mutual fund related investments.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"I have been using Paytm Money for sometime now and the experience has been great. The userinterface is smooth and easy to understand. Thetransactions and swift. They also have risk assesment tool, schemes by Paytm Advisory, and much more. More over all these funds are direct so nothing is charged by Paytm Money which is a major plus point.
",positive
Paytm Money,Reddit,"The app has a very friendly UI and makes mutual fund investment a breeze. I have been investing in direct funds since 2012 directly via AMC websites, and the process was pretty tiresome. Here I started SIPs in like 4 clicks, which blew my mind. I was hesitant to use this considering all the 1 star reviews, but when I read those reviews, I found that these were just comments of 1st time investors like, holding money on weekends, can't change KYC details, etc. which is something not an intermediary can do anyways. 1 star less because I do agree phone support is needed when money is involved. Also the external portfolio is bugged and doesn't show my investments correctly. It is being worked upon, but hasn't been fixed yet. Overall a great app. Maybe you guys should do training videos for 1st time investors and answer their FAQs.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"This platform got some serious issues, The recent BeStar integration which made the whole buying and selling of funds more difficult one. My sell order has not placed more than 3 days and later rejected; due to this I faced loss.

Don’t know where and whom to write other than customer care.

Paytm Money,Reddit,"I am a long time MF investor since 2001 and fully KYC compliant. I was excited to open an account with PayTM Money and give it a try. That is when my disappointment began. I was pushed into the waiting list at a number exceeding 200000. So I opted for the 'I Want Faster Access' option and filled all the details including a copy of my cancelled cheque for verification. Despite having a KYC verified account with PayTM, it has been more than a week and I'm still waiting for access. This is a very poor start by PayTM.

A comprehensive diagram would enhance understanding. I've encountered a major glitch in the app—sometimes it doesn't respond to actions. Yesterday, I exited my shares, but the app still showed them as present. This issue can be resolved.

Dhani Stocks,Play,"It offers excellent functionality and thorough analysis capabilities, but its UI, while upscale, feels cumbersome and needs to be reduced. In the F&O area, transactions are not leaving properly, necessitating manual stop-loss modifications to register profits. The programme allows you to browse numerous charts, however it does not always execute sell orders smoothly, and its overall responsiveness may be improved. A noteworthy drawback is the lack of chart view options in the positions pane

Dhani Stocks,Play,"1. Price dont updates and Stucks during inserting price and SL before order 2. Order Execution time takes 3-4 Seconds ( Why can't u remove this? and keep IN STANT BUY/SELL option) 3. BAD INTERFACE, it looks like Many apps combined in it. 4. Plz Remove Animations, we are not gamers. Suggestion - provide option, which segment we wants to see in App , like I dont trade in Gold ,ETF, CRUDE OIL, so it will Make user interface more clear than Crowdy. or make lighter versions

Dhani Stocks,Play,"Better than others!! Although generally good, the app might use several enhancements: 1. A quicker loading time for the chart; 2. Better stop-loss drag-and-drop, as it's not working at the moment. This app has been in my use for a year. You started offering real-time market news recently, which is fantastic and something that no other demat account provides. All stock news in real time would be helpful. Though brought out several times, it appears to be disregarded: Kindly incorporate.

Dhani Stocks,Play,"Team Dhan, I'd love to see a feature that allows the TSL trigger and limit function to be dynamically linked. Specifically, if I adjust one, the other would automatically adjust by the set percentage. Currently, changing one setting affects the other, but I believe this enhancement would improve the user experience.

Dhani Stocks,Play,"The app has some positive qualities, such as competitive brokerage rates and useful functionality for purchasing and selling stocks. Clients enjoy the competent guidance, simple navigation, and speedy transaction execution. However, the interface is crowded and lacks thoughtful design, resulting in a terrible user experience. Enhancements are required, such as streamlining the layout, adding a landscape view, and lowering chart latency. The tax PNL Report is substandard, with no date-specific.

Dhani Stocks,Play,"It's a nice platform but need to improve the lagging issue .I think it will be far better in next 1 year.

Dhani Stocks,Play,"Over amazing!! While opening an account with Dhan is easy, there are some indicators and a screener missing from Tradingview on Dhans. There is still a problem where Tradingview charts vanish when the application is minimised and then reopened, necessitating a close and open of the app. Despite this, Dhan's trading interface is easy to use, with sophisticated features and dependable functionality. Dhan is a great option for traders because of its user-friendly design and extensive feature set.

Dhani Stocks,Play,"The default chart option frequently changes from Trading View to Chart IQ due to a broken biometric lock. This needs to be fixed right now. Furthermore, there are long wait periods for customer service. Notwithstanding these problems, the app functions rather well overall, offering a wide range of services on a single platform. Nevertheless, the contract notes are not supplied on the same trading day, coming either late or not at all, and the interface feels congested. Thanks

Dhani Stocks,Play,"Well organised!! The Dhan App is acclaimed for its user-friendly UI and various useful features, although users suggest improvements, such as updating profit and loss (P&L) after entering a position and reducing chart lag. Visuals are outstanding, growth is swift, and packages are competitively priced; nonetheless, the interface appears cluttered, and a horizontal view would be useful. Some users encounter character difficulties and dark screens. The app makes buying and selling stocks easy

Dhani Stocks,Play,"Pretty bad for intraday. If you're trading on the charts using gocharting then you'll have to exit your position 15 seconds before you actually want to because that's how long it takes to exit. I've lost money just because it doesn't close your position on time when you exit orders on the chart. Came from groww but I am very disappointed. Might end up switching back.

",positive
Dhani Stocks,Play,"The Dhan app is admirable, but its user interface has to be simplified because it appears busy and lacks sensible design. Improving the user experience is critical. The app charges less brokerage than competitors, which is good. However, the Tax PNL Report is inadequate since it lacks date-specific scrip details, making tax filing difficult for CAs. The GTT option for selling equities requires the scrip in your account, which presents a challenge for swing traders. Otherwise nice platform.

The point is if user has enabled private dns other than DNS.GOOGLE or its affiliates THIS app will give you error stating "" ..Serve you better once you have your SIGNAL back"". Even this app doesn't work if AUTOMATIC private dns is enabled. Looks very fishy and suspicious. I doubt if the app is gathering any inside private data. However APP works fine on ANY DNS over iPhone. The screen recording preserved.

My home feed is 99% random people, not accounts I actually follow, which defeats the purpose of following anyone. I recommend having the home feed only have posts from people I follow and a separate search/discovery page that will show new accounts that post similar content to them. to follow.

Long term and short term holding is not distinctly shown in the statement. similarly, P & L statement with reference to cost price and market price is not clearly spelt out. when introducing new web page there should not be drastic change in the design.

Motilal Oswal,Reddit,"Motilal oswal site and app are very nicely designed and developed for comparing funds and making a decision to invest but lately they have revised their policies where investors had to submit paper mandates for their sip which becomes a tedious task.

Motilal Oswal,Reddit,"Since my acct opening in Sept.2023 I have been experiencing with MO Investor mobile application and found that it needs to be improved a lot more than other Brokers' platform features. Option chain is missing for next two months but only current month chain is available. Other point is that Pay out column does not seem to be user friendly wherein you can't see the status of amount withdrawn at initial stage and you can't modify or cancel the pay out made once it is done.

Angel Broking,Play,"Updated review: I appreciate Angel ones recent layout update and changes. Everything is quick and within reach while trading. However one major feedback which I believe is a game changer- Kindly change the stop loss order system in such a way where a user can quickly edit an stop Loss order into a market sell order. Similar to zerodha, Right now A User would have to first cancel and then sell. This can lead to unexpected losses. The Stocks screen can display events on the portfolio itself.

Angel Broking,Play,"Few bugs noticed recently: 1.When the phone region is set to outside India (Germany), the decimal system goes corrupt from time to time. 2.Sometimes after the market has closed, the app doesn't remember the average buying cost of a stock, and thereby shows very high daily profit margins. works great otherwise.

Angel Broking,Play,"Features required: If I have sorted any watchlist on the basis of any option, just store that as a data. Everytime I open, I have to sort it again and again. Why multiple times the stock can be added in a single watchlist, there is no need for it to add the same one in the single watchlist Give some feature which shows and group the stocks as per sector in the watchlist And also make the UX better for the portfolio screen. The total value seems to be a P&L and the actual P&L is in small

Angel Broking,Play,"Overall good app but The platform is unsuitable for trading owing to delayed chart and option loading, erroneous candle outcomes, and frequent data update errors. Despite the high brokerage fees, the service is mediocre, with constant issues even on good network connections. Charts and indicators frequently disappear, hurting strategy development, and the platform only supports 5G and WiFi, failing on 3G and 4G. Furthermore, the options function is unreliable. The mobile app often hangs.

As in case of Shares holding tray, you can't directly go to trading window.

Angel Broking,Play,"very useful, glitch free...some feature can be improved, e.g. charting shall be saved for profile and needn't to be done every week.

Ideally these should be saved for a particular user and show every time u open a chart. Also the functions get disappears after some time e.g. triple SMA, EMA line, RSI etc.

Sharekhan,Play,"App Is Good But Chart View not good, you need to improve your chart view and chart settings. It doesn't have customize time frame function. I am going to view chart other apps charts and after placing order on share khan this is so bad. I am thinking that you should have to improve your chart view and have to add more setting options to your chart settings. Thanks.

Sharekhan,Play,"Good until u need reach customer care.. They have strict method of defining problem, - that its not an issue unless there is a video or screenshot of problem received via email. For momentary false quote of share, screenshot can't be taken.. But then complain is not registered.

It's very irritating when u need to login again and again when u reopen it after minimizing the App for few mins... Due to this I have left using the app and shifted to other Apps.. This team is also very lazy and not even considering clients reviews, as last time I commented that app not providing Order confirmation for order.. this update is still pending. So very poor response.

Sharekhan,Play,"App experience is good, but the brokerage charges are very expensive and rarely afforable especially if you are an intraday/swing trader. Also, they charge extra if your brokerage on sale of a scrip is less than 21 rupees.

Still there's 1 glitch which has not been fixed yet, If you look for any stock in detail view in sectoral index section, once you hit the back button, it should take you back to the same stock list within the same index however it takes user directly on the main page i.e the 1st page where 1 can see indian and global indices if not changed from default.

Sharekhan,Play,"The app was good initially but then it started asking for update. When I tried to update the app neither it was updated nor was opening with the previous version. Then I uninstalled the app and now I am not able to download this app as everytime it stuck at 99% downloaded and then it stops. I removed many apps and videos etc to clear the space but it's still not working. Can you resolve the problem ?

Sharekhan,Play,"1. Volume button does not work in classroom videos 2. can not rotate screen and fo full screen for classroom videos 3. UI for buy and sell is very confusing and is not intuitive. 4. Too many clicks and touches are required for one trade by that time prices moves up or down. 5. In charts update rate of candle sticks is too slow very difficult to follow the price trend. 6. Accessibility to order book, net position, DP SR is not on main screen.

Sharekhan,Play,"I have created trend lines in the app on old phone. But those trend lines are not available on another phone. Can user data be stored on the server instead of the device. Is there a way I can transfer the trend lines from one phone to another (export / import or copy files). Your app stops updating DOW and S&P 500 data at 12 am IST. The markt data closes at 1:30 or 2:30 am. This data is not updated till next day when US market starts. This used to work properly earlier.

Sharekhan,Play,"Application is fine. Just one concern. Password expires frequently. Even in banking application it expires after a year.

Sharekhan,Play,"Horrible app. 1. Keeps on ""initialising"" and u need to wait eternally to let the app open. Have already tried uninstalling and installing, still doesn't work. 2. The two factor authentication method is horrible. When you open your portfolio and the app is unable to read your biometric properly, the interface gets stuck. And you will need to close and re-open the app. No other option. Bugs, bugs, and more bugs. After so many negative reviews, the dev/testing team would hv been fired.

Sharekhan,Play,"Really Buggy app, the company used to provide very good service and i have had no issues untill recently when they launched their new app. The app fails to load exactly whenever there is sharp market movement.

Some day your app will not show my portfolio balance.

Sharekhan,Play,"Please add a swipe to place order feature like zerodha has. Or atleast, when placing order, show the real time prices, because when I place limit orders, I'm asked to hit the confirm button where I can't see the prices, if the price has moved away, my limit order will never be triggered! I need to see real time prices even as I confirm the order. Otherwise, its the best app I've ever seen.

I'm not having a good time with this broker, I will switch to others soon!

Sharekhan,Play,"It's a good platform, but several UX improvements are possible to make experience better. While two factor authentication aids security the monthly password change policy is difficult to keep up with. Also the interface with CDSL can be improved.

Thank you for asking The charts are not working properly both on the web and app mainly in currency No tutorial videos on how to use the app. Where can I check my funds and balances Overall look and feel is not up to the mark.

Sharekhan,Play,"Good but there are few things which needed to be fixed or updated. 1. There is no option to see daily balance amount in our account to proceed with the trading. We have to maintain it seperately in our dairy or paper on a daily basis. 2. There is no option to view contract notes, which is a very negative thing. 3. Only 50 names allowed per market watch is very less. Minimum should be 100. 4. Portfolio management is a mess. 5. Can be more user friendly.

Sharekhan,Play,"Not easy to know everything in app. The app have so many options which is difficult for a fresher to understand. If small description about every menu is attached along with menu itself (without going to you tube or google) then it will be very helpful.

Sharekhan,Reddit,"There is always problem in opening capital gain report. I have repeatedly shared the problem. Even the fund balance is not clear and there is chance of default payment. Brokerage charge should also be displayed. Over all it is quite user friendly, except for frequent server problem. Must look other demat accounts to add some useful features for the customer who trust it so much

Sharekhan,Reddit,"This is the worst app of all, it will open the account of the customer but will not close it because you will keep taking annual fee from you, while other apps close the account after writing a mail, so please know to close the account before opening the account. Take it because later you may not have to repent. I have sent my own foam twice and mail has been sent ten times but it has not worked, that's why they probably have the least number of customers.

Sharekhan,Reddit,"Below average effort plagued by multiple performance issues. For instance, desktop client mostly takes orders during after market hours, but the mobile app shows market as closed at that same time.This 'closed‘ market status on the mobile app can continue for hours, making app inoperable & forcing one to switch to website/trade tiger to eventually place orders during after hours.Inconvenient & unreliable. Reported issue to Customer care who are either woefully unaware or intentionally ignorant.

Nuvama,Play,"This app is the worst trading app available. It has login problems.. The app doesn't recognize the user id.

Nuvama,Play,"I have recently opened an ac here but I found adding any script , specially option is very time taking, so many times we need to click to add. Very annoying ! Every Time , we need to across from top to see Index Value. Why not show it permanently on the Top. ???

Nuvama,Play,"Most hopeless trading application. Very inconvenient to trade. Cross hair in chart is cumbersome to activate. Important technical indicators missing. Prices do not get updated. One has to refresh every time. Price shown in positions do not get updated except rarely. Even their TX3 is not convenient to trade. Hopeless. Arrogant Management of Nuvama is indifferent. Features of Dhan are far superior (no comparison) and better than ZERODHA.

Edit: 5th Oct 2023 Option chain Nifty OI change for 3 strikes shows -214.75L. Its just misleading.

Nuvama,Play,"I liked the app very much except below 2 observations. 1. App is hanging and crashing some times due to invalid session i guess. After reopening app from crash it is asking for relogin, please fix this issue. 2. Charts are not user friendly, please bring tradingview charts as other option like other broker apps.

Nuvama,Play,"Facing lot of loading issue in the app. Most of the the time holding statement and portfolio reports just keep on loading and never open. Also, MF interface could be improved. Currently I can view details of MF which I know my name, however, if I want to explore the market there is not much available that facilitates it.

Nuvama,Play,"Your app is excellent but chart portion an option chain analysis needs to be work out. Angel spark has provided very good chart pattern and option chain analysis.

No proper response, 15 days to address one query, and not yet resolved the issue. Pathetic and Frustrating support by backend team. To modify the bank acc details, they are taking 15 days. Brilliant. Wonderful Backend Team Support. App is very user-friendly. But the support team is pathetic.

Nuvama,Play,"Edelweiss was recommended to me by my teacher to learn investing and trading. I was keen to do the same but their services are seriously very poor. They charge minimal brokerage at inception of account but soon after 3-4 months the charges are doubled or tripled. Whenever I get sign of investing and I place order, the same are not placed and useless reasons are popped up. The customer care services are far worse than it could ever be anywhere. The people sitting there to help us are just feed with 1-2 lines that they keep on repeating without applying their mind what query is raised by customers. Was very excited to trade here but this platform sucks. Seriously Very very disappointed by the services.

Nuvama,Play,"I am not giving it a five star because there's always some issue while refreshing positions. Please make the application more light by removing things that are not required. Provide external links for the things that are unnecessary.

Nuvama,Play,"App is decent but the last update removed dividend reports, with no warning or explanation. New reports are also in light mode, looking completely different and disconnected from the rest of the App, harder to use and understand. Update - the above issue was rolled back, and then a few months later put back again with the dark mode added but still no dividend reports. Now you have to download the entire year's tax report as an excel, open it separately, then search for the month's dividends.

Nuvama,Play,"Lots of bugs that needs to be fixed. One of the annoying one is asking for password reset everytime when you open the app and the slow scrip refresh.

Nuvama,Play,"Nuvama is a fraud company involved in account bungling. It squared off my ITC future lot at the lowest price of day and only credited the lot margin to my limits and the profit was not credited. Same it did with my Tata chemical lot. My previous tickets/complaints are evidences of manipulation of accounts aimed at causing me losses, but no action by nuvama. This is bungling in accounts by Nuvama. Nuvama does not consider itself accountable. I have also reported it to SEBI for mal-practices.

Nuvama,Play,"New version of App does not have features like Portfolio and its options like old option, old App version of Edelweiss was very good and user friendly, nuvama is updating app frequently but no use, lot of filter options are missing hence no visibility of stocks, they need to bring back old app features or slowly need to shift to other broking agency.

The Relationship Managers they assign are so dumb and useless, they become a liability to you. There are much better options than this!!!!

HDFC Securities,Reddit,"I am not finding this new app user friendly. The font size is so small and colour scheme is so poor that readability is difficult. Old app Hdfc Securities was far better which has been blocked without any intimation. Needs lots of improvement to enhance usability. No setting tab to manage suitability, personalisation etc and scores of other issues. Till you improve this app please provide the option to use the old app.

HDFC Securities,Reddit,"For an app that's been positioned as the go-to by HDFC, it clearly has a lot of bugs. Best reply by customer service is to HDFC Securities app. Derivaties positions does not show up in the portfolio page. Only way to see it is through the trades - net/open positions. And there also the positions don't show up randomly. Sincerely hope that HDFC is doing something about it

HDFC Securities,Reddit,"Getting logged out very soon. Even after MPIN and touchlD are set. Every time it says password expired and asks for password and OTP. Issue persists even after data and cache clear. Even tried reinstalling app. I am going to stop using this app. Update: above behavior is because of an expired password. Old app brings up a screen to change password when it is expired. This app is allowing you to login with an expired password and then throws you out after switch to something else and comeback.

HDFC Securities,Reddit,"While I appreciate the ability to set stop-loss orders, I believe there's an opportunity to enhance the user experience by incorporating the option to set take-profit (target) orders as well. As a trader, it's crucial for me to have both stop-loss and take-profit orders in place to manage my positions effectively, especially when I cannot monitor the screen continuously for extended periods. If implementing take-profit orders is not feasible, I may need to explore alternative trading platforms

HDFC Securities,Reddit,"First of all I would like to thank you for providing such a unique and versatile platform. I was new to the stock market when I started using the app. The best feature is research option where you provide fundamental and technical picks. I have to just invest and relax. It's accurate most of the times. Making profits becomes so easy. Secondly I like the news section. Though I refer to news on other platforms too but selecting the most relevant ones becomes a tedious task. The app makes it simple
